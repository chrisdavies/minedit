# minedit

Minimal, shell-like interface to Google drive. It allows for a very simple, focused text-editing experience (via the edit command).

See it in action here:

## Notes

Type help to see a list of commands.

Because Ctrl + C generally means copy, Esc is instead used to quit the current command.

When editing, Esc is how you exit. Ctrl + S is how you save.


## TODO:

* mv command
* autocomplete via tab key
* first-run experience/help
* remember last pwd when loading (via local-storage)
* offline support?
* auto-save?
